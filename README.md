# Tree Generation Unity

## Project

This is a procedural tree generator on Unity based on **L-systems**. This project was made during a virtual world course at the Gamagora computer science master degree in the University of Lyon II.

This is only a prototype, but the main goal of this project is to generate 3D tree models using L-Systems. Moreover we want to build a tool that can be used by graphic designer to create personalized tree more easily.
